# odin-recipes

This project is meant to put all the previous HTML lessons on the ODIN project foundations course into practice. 
I will be making a main page, index.html and several secondary pages the main page will link to. 
On the main page you can find the links (with names) of three recipes.
The secondary pages will all have one of these recipes with a picture of the resulting dish included. They will also be able to link back to the main page.
This means I will be putting the following things into practice:  

<
- base html boilerplate writing
- attributing links and images
- writing and very basic layouts
- git commit message writing
