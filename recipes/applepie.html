    <p>This vegan apple pie recipe is found on <a href="https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/255858/vegan-apple-pie/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">All recipes vegan apple pie</a>. It is by <strong>Kaitlynls</strong> I have no ownership of the recipe.</p>
    <p>Kaitlynls describes their recipe as follows: "This vegan apple pie recipe is delicious! My family raved â€” and I made it myself. With no animal products, the crust is very buttery and light. Serve right out of the oven, chilled, or slightly warmed."</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <h4>Crust</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>2 1/3 cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 cup vegan margarine (such as earth balance)</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon white sugar</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1/4 cup ice water</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Filling</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup brown sugar</li>
        <li>1/2 cup vegan margarine (such as earth balance)</li>
        <li>1/4 cup rice milk</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons ground cinnamon</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon ground nutmeg</li>
        <li>7 granny smith apples - peeled, cored and sliced</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Combine 2 1/3 cups all-purpose flour, 1 cup vegan margarine, 1 tablespoon white sugar, and salt in a food processor; pulse until mixture clumps together. Pour water in slowly and pulse a few times until a dough forms. </li>
        <li>Transfer dough to a flat work surface; knead for 30 seconds and shape into a disk. Wrap with plastic wrap and refrigerate until firm, about 30 minutes. </li>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). </li>
        <li>Dust a flat work surface with flour. Roll dough out into two 10-inch crusts. Press 1 crust gently into a 9-inch pie plate. </li>
        <li>Combine brown sugar, 1/2 cup vegan margarine, 1/4 cup white sugar, rice milk, 3 tablespoons flour, cinnamon, and nutmeg in a saucepan; cook and stir over medium heat until margarine melts and brown sugar is dissolved, 3 to 5 minutes. </li>
        <li>Place apple slices in a large bowl. Pour brown sugar mixture on top; mix until apples are evenly coated. Pile apples into the bottom crust. Cover with second crust. Cut slits in the top crust with a sharp knife. </li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until crust is golden brown and apples are semitranslucent, 45 to 60 minutes. </li>

    <h3>Tips from the author</h3>
    <p>These tips are from the original recipe, so I thought i'd add them for other people with allergies!</p>
    <p> Millet flour worked really well in crust and makes it gluten free.

        Substitute water for rice milk if desired.
        
        Brushing dough with vegan margarine and sprinkling sugar on top adds a pretty finishing touch. </p>
